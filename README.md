## Object 
How important are live fans for a win? We wanted to know how professional sports have fared in this new empty-stadium world. Since the NBA/WNBA had nearly-complete seasons compared to other sports, we decided to analyze professional basketball seasons before and during the Covid-19 pandemic in order to see how player performance "in the bubble," i.e. without fans, was impacted.
